# R2-D7 Legacy
An adaptation of the bot for xwingtmg.slack.com (and Discord) for X-Wing Legacy 2.0 rules

Supports Slack and Discord!

(Bot is still in testing, so the installation links have been removed)

# Features
## Detects links to lists 
-  <https://xwing-legacy.com/> and prints the lists in chat
- Just paste the list URL into chat, and let the bot handle it! (on Windows, you can press F6 then CTRL+C, and paste into chat)
## Card lookup via [[]] queries
  - [[:t65xwing:luke]] will trigger a response with Luke Skywalker's pilot details
  - [[luke]] will trigger a response letting you choose between the Pilot and the Gunner cards.
  - [[marksmanship]] will trigger a response with the Marksmanship card's details
  - [[fang]] will show the Fang Fighter ship chassis information (stats, maneuvers, ship ability), and list the pilots that exist for that ship.
  - Try looking up [[hellothere]] or [[squid]] ;)
## Card Image Lookup via {{}} queries
## Basic dice rolls with stats from http://gateofstorms.net/2/multi/

# Running locally
## Setup
Set up a virtual env and install requirements. Standard python stuff, but
easy to forget so it's written here for convenience.
```
mkdir env               # only needed 1st time
python3 -m venv env     # only needed 1st time
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
First, create or obtain a slack (or discord) token (see slack API documentation).
Then set your token as an environment variable and launch r2d7:
```
export SLACK_TOKEN="123456-your-slack-token-here"
python -m r2d7.slack
```
Or for discord:
```
export DISCORD_TOKEN="123456-your-discord-token-here"
python -m r2d7.discord
```
